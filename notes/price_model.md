# Market Model Exploration

I want to explore ideas about markets and analyze market data from different angles to discover market inefficiencies that could lead to profitable trading strategies.

## Synthetic Data Generation Model

The goal is to generate synthetic data that mimics real market behavior to understand key market forces and their interactions. Here's the proposed model:

### 1. Fair Price Process
Let $F(t)$ be the fair price, which in log-space follows either:
- A Gaussian random walk with scale $s$, or
- Levy fluctuations with parameter $\mu$ (where $p(l) \propto l^{-1-\mu}$ for each move)

### 2. Smoothed Log-Price
The exponentially smoothed last log-price $L(t,k)$ is defined as:

$$L(t,k) = \frac{1}{k} \cdot \text{close}(t) + \frac{k-1}{k} \cdot L(t-1,k)$$

### 3. Agent Price Estimation
Each market participant estimates the fair log-price using their parameters $(\alpha, k, \sigma)$:

$$\text{estimate}(t,\alpha,k,\sigma) = \alpha F(t) + (1-\alpha)L(t,k) + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)$$

where:
- $\alpha$: insight level about fair price
- $\sigma$: noise level in estimates

### 4. Agent Trading Behavior
Each agent has parameters:
- Wealth ($W$)
- Delay ($D$)
- Aggressiveness ($A$)
- Uncertainty ($\delta$) in log-space

Orders are placed at prices $\exp(\text{estimate}(t-D,\alpha,k,\sigma) \pm \delta)$ with order size $W \cdot A$

### 5. Trading Process Variants

#### 5.1 Persistent Order Book Process
- Trading actions follow a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$
- Orders persist between iterations in the order book
- For each action, a new i.i.d. agent is sampled with their parameters
- Orders accumulate over time, creating market depth and liquidity dynamics

#### 5.2 Period-based Process
- Time is divided into regular periods
- In each period:
  1. Start with an empty order book
  2. Sample $N \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda)$ agents
  3. Generate and process orders from these agents
  4. Record any trades that occurred
  5. Discard the order book
  6. Move to next period
- Each period represents one price point in the resulting time series

### 6. Parameter Priors
- $\alpha \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_0, \alpha_1)$
- $k \sim \text{Gamma}(k_\alpha, k_\theta)$
- $\sigma \sim \text{Gamma}(\sigma_\alpha, \sigma_\theta)$
- $W \sim \text{Pareto}(w_m, w_\alpha)$
- $D \sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_D, \sigma_D)$
- $\frac{A}{1-A} \sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu_A, \sigma_A)$
- $\delta \sim \text{Gamma}(\delta_\alpha, \delta_\theta)$

## Exploration Approaches

1. **Direct Sampling**
   - Generate multiple histories with different parameter sets
   - Analyze resulting patterns and statistics

2. **GAN-based Approach**
   - Use Generative Adversarial Networks to match real market data
   - Fine-tune parameters through adversarial training

3. **Differentiable Sequence Model**
   - Train a differentiable model conditioned on parameters
   - Optimize parameter values to maximize fit with real data
